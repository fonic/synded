- OPEN                                                                         -

- Investigate how to print proper errors for file operations like
  'fread'; currently, reading an RNC encoded file results in:
  Error reading input file 'GAME99/GAME99.DAT': Success
  -> 'strerror(errno)' does NOT seem to work for file operations (at least not
     for all, seems to work e.g. for fseek)

- Instead of using FIXED values for OFFSET defines in 'gamedata.h', use macro
    #include <stddef.h>
    size_t offsetof(type, member)
  to calculate these during compile time (macro yields global offsets, global
  offset - global offset of member 'Unknown' == relative offset)

- Implement an algorithm for reconstructing MapWho to allow arbitrary placement
  of added things
  -> See function 'move_mapwho()' and similar in RGAME.C

- Think about changing MapWho from:
     uint16_t MapWho[TILES_COUNT_X * TILES_COUNT_Y];
  -to-
     uint16_t MapWho[TILES_COUNT_Y][TILES_COUNT_X];
  -> Seems more natural, but introduces issues regarding multidimensional array
     as arguments to functions (briefly tested: declaration of ‘mapwho’ as
     multidimensional array must have bounds for all dimensions except the
     first), so might not be desirable after all
  -> Investigate

- Fix compiler warnings on Windows

- Implement handling of RNCed files (currently using simple file size check to
  rule out RNCed files as valid input files, thus low priority)

- Beta version GAMExx.DAT files are currently incompatible (tested by Moburma);
  investigate the differences and check if other versions have discrepancies
  as well in that regard

- Further refine game data structs
  -> ONGOING, will take some time + input from Mefistotelis

- Test compiling on Windows
  -> Do this from time to time to ensure changes don't break Windows support

- Implement basic user menu for viewing/editing:
  1 - Print People
  2 - Print Vehicles
  3 - Print Objects
  4 - Print ...
  ...
  Choice >
  -> Not in the near future, editing via code is perfectly fine for now

- DONE                                                                         -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add enum + _to_str() function for Thing.Angle to 'gdenums.h' + integrate into
  CSV output:

  Angle ranges (from testing, as it appears on-screen):
  0xF0 - 0x0F: South-West
  0x10 - 0x2F: South
  0x30 - 0x4F: South-East
  0x50 - 0x6F: East
  0x70 - 0x8F: North-East
  0x90 - 0xAF: North
  0xB0 - 0xCF: North-West
  0xD0 - 0xEF: West

-> Might get revised later if it should turn out that ACTUAL world orientation
   (i.e. considering the isometric perspective) is better suited

- Make compiler warning visible and fix as many as possible

- Implement file size check for input file (to detect and deny incompatible
  files, e.g. RNCed or from beta version)

- Use comment blocks from 'gdenums.s' for separation of structs in 'gamedata.h'
  as well; add brief description to each struct regarding its use

- Add defines for all currently hard-coded parameters in 'gamedata.h':
  TILES_COUNT_X
  TILES_COUNT_Y
  PEOPLE_COUNT
  VEHICLES_COUNT
  ...
  PEOPLE_GLOBAL_OFFSET
  VEHICLES_GLOBAL_OFFSET
  ...
  PEOPLE_RELATIVE_OFFSET
  VEHICLES_RELATIVE_OFFSET
  ...
  -> GLOBAL offsets are useful to identify items within GAMExx.DAT directly
  -> RELATIVE offsets are important for game data, as all references use these
     (e.g. Person holding a Weapon via Person.ChildWeapon)
  -> Move OFFSET_GLOBAL_TO_RELATIVE from 'csvoutput.c' to 'gamedata.h', then
     add OFFSET_RELATIVE_TO_GLOBAL macro
  -> Use these new defines and macros throughout SyndED instead of previously
     hard-coded values (affects mostly 'synded.c')
-> DONE; CAUTION: this required MASSIVE code changes, thus there might be
   regressions (!)

- In 'csvoutput.h'/'csvoutput.c', set 'size_t offset_global' and 'size_t offset_
  relative' to CONST and then calculate offsets using index for CSV output in-
  stead of using 'offset_global += sizeof(Command); offset_relative += sizeof(
  Command);':
  offset_global + i * sizeof(Struct),
  offset_relative + i * sizeof(Struct),
- Set all other arguments in functions of 'csvoutput.h'/'csvoutput.c' to const
  as well, just for good measure

- Modify editing example for GAME01.DAT to make use of deciphered Vehicle.State
  (i.e. place APC + Soldier, Police Car + Police Man, Normal Car + Criminal)
  and newly introduced defines for relative offsets

- Add macro to 'gamedata.h' to calculate MapWho offset from Xpos/Ypos:
  #define POSITION_TO_MAPWHO_OFFSET(xpos, ypos) \
      (ypos >> 8) * TILES_COUNT_X + (xpos >> 8)

- Add enum for Vehicle.State to 'gdenums.h' + integrate into CSV output

- Changes enums in 'gdenums.h' to typedefs, then change _to_str() functions
  from '(const enum PersonState value)' to '(const PersonState value)' (enum
  keyword no longer necessary when using typedefs)

- Deconstruct struct MapWho into struct GameData:
  /*      6 0x00006 */  MapWho       MapWho;
  becomes:
  /*      6 0x00006 */  uint16_t     MapWho[128*128];
  -> There is no real benefit in having a struct with just a single member

- Calculate Xtile + Ytile for things that can appear on map:
  uint16_t XPos/YPos -> higher 8 bits = tile, lower 8 bits = offset within tile
  (according to FreeSynd)

- Translate known values into human-readable strings for CSV output
  (e.g. Person.Unique, Person.Status, Weapon.State, etc.)

- Change Unique in struct Person to uint16_t, eliminate following HugDistance1,
  rename Hugdistance2 to just HugDistance

- Add local offset to CSV output of Commands (to make reference via Command.Next
  visible/readable)

- Revise comments in 'gamedata.h'

- Write MapWho struct to CSV file (128 columns, 128 rows)

- Apply fixes + test compiling on Windows -> WORKS
- Add asprintf library (to allow compiling on Windows)

- Verify and fix CSV output

- Output ALL contents of GameData struct to CSV files

- Deconstruct struct MapInfo into separate members (like in RGAME.C)

- Change command line:
  $ synded INFILE OUTFILE
- Read entire input file into structure GameData
- Write entire output file from structure GameData

- Verify structs (together with Moburma and Mefistotelis)
  -> DONE for now, but will be ongoing (still stuff to figure out / correct)

- Add prints for struct sizes
- Add prints for struct member offsets

- Fill structs MapInfo, Objective, CPObjective

- Restructure GitHub repo

- Move structs to separate header file 'gamedata.h'

- Create base structure as a starting point
