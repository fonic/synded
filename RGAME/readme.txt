Extracted from 3DO CD Image. Present in folder 'DATA' on all kinds of 3DO releases (France, Japan, Germany).

Presumably a converter to convert PC version GAMExx.DAT files to console version AGAMExx.DAT files.

Incomplete, as several includes are missing:
#include "syndicat.h"
#include "macros.h"
#include "libstruc.h"
